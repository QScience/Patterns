:description: Patterns allows easy configuration

Introduction
------------

Complex websites and web applications can be created by combining
configurations of Modules, Fields, Content Types, Menus, Blocks,
Categories, Roles / Permissions, etc... This site setup and
configuration process is a very time consuming and repetitive
bottleneck.

The Patterns module is built to bypass this bottleneck by managing and
automating site configuration. Site configuration is stored in YAML, XML, or
PHP files called Patterns. These files have a structure which is
easy to read, modify, manage, & share and can be executed manually or as
a part of an automated web site deployment.

Installation
------------

Patterns is installed as a Drupal module. Its dependencies are the Token and Libraries modules.
It makes uses of external libraries which must be installed separately:
*+Spyc+* and *+Codemirror+*.


* http://code.google.com/p/spyc/[*+Spyc+*] is a native PHP library used to parse YAML files. It is
   necessary for the correct functioning of Patterns.

* http://codemirror.net/[*+Codemirror+*] is a Javascript library which
   considerably enhances the interface of the Patterns editor page. It
   is _not_ necessary for the correct functioning of Patterns, but
   recommended.

Both libraries should be installed under *+sites/all/libraries/+*
under directory names of *+spyc+* and *+codemirror2+*.

What is a Pattern?
------------------

A Pattern is a file composed by an *+info+* section (generic metadata about the pattern)
and a sequence of _action_s of the type *+create+*, *+modify+*, or *+delete+* grouped in
categories (sections). The 'tag:' expression tells Patterns which component to use.
Every component defines a list of tags it can handle, see <<callbacks,later>>. After choosing the 'tag',
the pattern file has to supply every required data for the particular action.
In this example: 'name', 'machine_name', 'description', 'hierarchy' are some of the datakeys used,
and all of them have values assigned.
The data is passed to the pattern component as an associative array, most often referred to as *+$data+*.
Some actions have alternative or optional parameter requirements.

Categories can be arbitrarily defined (excluding the
<<reserved-words,reserved words>>) and are executed sequentially.

-------------------

Two other optional sections names are *+modules+* and *+include+*.
*+modules+* explicitly defines a list of modules to enable during the execution of the
pattern, while *+include+* loads the actions of another
pattern into the current one. *More explanation later* *TODO*

How Patterns works
------------------

Pattern works by parsing the pattern file and then constructing a form
which contains the values for specific elements. The form is
then validated and submitted, just as if the 'submit' button had been pressed from
a browser window.

The processing can be done in two ways. The *+Batch+* mode uses Drupal's Batch API
to run the patterns in the background. This helps overcome the time limitations
and the user gets feedback of the progress. The other method, which is called *+PHP+*,
executes the tasks in a single PHP run. In this case, debugging can be easier.

[[callbacks]]
How to implement Patterns for your own module
-----------------------------------------------

In order to have your custom module be able to benefit from patterns,
you must create a 'component', much like a driver software. The main components
reside in *+patterns/components/+*, although modules can use the *+hook_patterns_components+* hook
to expand the set of supported components.

You need to implement at most 8 pattern hooks, as here explained in the same
order as they are being called by Patterns module. For examples, see *+block.inc+*, *+system.inc+*, *+taxonomy.inc+*.

*******************************************************************
* *+hook_patterns($data)+*: declares that the module is able to handle
  pattern configurations, and specifies which tags and forms are
  supported. The form mappings might depend on the Pattern data.

* *+hook_patterns_prepare($action, $tag, &$data)+*: checks the input and adds default
 values. Eventually, it can raise errors which halt further execution
 of the pattern.

* *+hook_patterns_validate($action, $tag, &$data)+*: this hooks is similar to the previous one, however,
you are working with the prepared data and you are checking against the database.

* *+hook_patterns_callbacks($action, $tag, &$data)+*: returns the array of form ID's which will be run
 sequentially.
 If a value in this array is not present in the form id list returned by *+hook_patterns()+*, the
 value will be treated as a regular callback function and will be called with the *+($action, $data)+* parameters.
 In this case, the next 3 functions are not called and the Pattern action result is provided by the callback function(s).

* *+hook_patterns_build($action, $form_id, &$data, &$action_state)+*: gets the form data for the
 action. This can either be just the form values, or it can be the
 full _form_state_ object.

* *+hook_patterns_params($action, $form_id, &$data &$action_state)+*: returns extra parameters that the form may require.

* *+hook_patterns_cleanup($action, $tag, &$data)+*: performs optional additional operations,
   after the execution of the action has finished.

* *+hook_patterns_get_arguments($action, $tag, $form_id, &$loop)+*: returns arguments needed for the forms when 
 using the automatic pattern import function. If arguments are given back for several executions, $loop needs to be
 set to true. Return arguments always in an array, if they're for several executions, create an array of arrays. 
 When you want to be able to extract all data, you will need to create an extra tag. When this tag is given to this function, it should then return all the arguments.
******************************************************************

where *+$action+* is one of the actions *+create+*, *+modify+*,
*+delete+* and *+$tag+* is the specific command to execute
(e.g. *+vocabulary+*, *+field+*, etc.).

*+hook_patterns+* is called independently from the others hooks, which
 are invoked sequentially to perform an action. In particular, if
 calling *+hook_patterns_prepare+*  and *+hook_patterns_validate+* does not raise error,
 moreover *+hook_patterns_prepare+* returns some form ID's, the engine do the following
 for each form ID:

 . execute *+hook_patterns_build+*, and *+hook_patterns_params+* while checking for errors; 
 . submit the form (call the Drupal function *+drupal_form_submit+*);
 . execute *+hook_patterns_cleanup+* while checking for errors.


Return values
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*+hook_patterns()+* 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Returns the following array of actions:
------------------
  $actions['tag1'] = array(
    PATTERNS_INFO => t('Description of this tag'), 
    PATTERNS_CREATE => array('form_to_create_tag1', 'form_to_create_tag2'),
    PATTERNS_MODIFY => array('form_to_modify_tag1', 'form_to_modify_tag2'),
    PATTERNS_DELETE => array('form_to_delete_tag1', 'form_to_delete_tag2'),
    PATTERNS_FILES  => $files = array('some file that needs to be included'),
  );
  $actions['tag2'] = ... ;
-----------------

where *+$tag1+*, *+$tag2+* etc. are specific commands to execute
(e.g. *+vocabulary+*, *+field+*, etc.). The list of possible form ID's is also provided 
for each of the three actions (*+create+*, *+modify+*, *+delete+*). Note that this array
can be empty as well, see <<callbacks,function hook_patterns_callbacks>>.


*+hook_patterns_build+*, *+hook_patterns_params+*, *+hook_patterns_cleanup+*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the other hooks return the following special associative array:

* *+status+*: One of *+[PATTERNS_SUCCESS, PATTERNS_WARN, PATTERNS_ERR]+*. Required.
* *+msg+*: A message.
* *+result+*: Any kind of additional data.

*+hook_patterns_get_arguments+*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Returns arguments needed for the forms when using the automatic pattern import function. If arguments are given back for several executions, $loop needs to be
 set to true. Return arguments always in an array, if they're for several executions, create an array of arrays.

Pattern execution modes
----------------------

Patterns execution can follow two distinct behaviors:

. *Extend*: adds the settings defined in the pattern file into the
    current instance, and leave untouched what not explicitly
    specified.

. *Run-Over*: re-configures the whole web site in order to create an
    instance with _exactly_ the settings defined by the pattern, and
    removes everything not explicitly specified.

Differences between Extend and Run-Over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The action +create+ changes according to the behavior selected for the
execution.

- *create*:  
       . _extends_ : always create a new entity;
       . _run-over_:  always check if the target entity is existing, if not, create it.;

- *modify*: check if the target entity exists and then modify
   it. Does nothing if the entity is not found;

- *delete*: check if the target entity exists and then delete
   it. Does nothing if the entity is not found.

Entity Matching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Entities are matched on the base of their +id+, if provided, or more
commonly on their +machine name+.

Current status of component implementations

Mostly works.

TODO: Only set a theme default if 'default' is 1.
TODO: Handle administration themes separately.

|====


Patterns function names conventions
-----------------------------------

TODO

Besides standard link:http://drupal.org/coding-standards[Drupal coding
conventions] the Patterns module uses the following naming conventions :

- *Function names*: functions declared in .inc files should contain
   the name of the .inc file in their
   name. E.g. *+patterns_io_save_pattern()+* is defined in
   *+includes/io.inc+*. Notice: does not apply for theme functions. 

- *AJAX call*: methods which are called during AJAX operations, and
   print directly their output instead of returning it should end with
   the suffix *+_service+*. E.g. : *+patterns_parser_validate_service()+*;


How Patterns files are saved and loaded
---------------------------------------

By default, the Patterns module hierarchically looks for patterns
files in the following locations:

1. the Drupal public files folder (usually *+/sites/default/files/patterns/*+);
2. a user defined folder (default: *+/sites/all/patterns/+*);
3. the Patterns module patterns directory (usually *+/sites/all/modules/patterns/patterns/+*);
4. any installation profile directory (e.g. *+/profiles/standard/patterns+*).

Patterns are files uniquely identified by the title in their info
section. If two or more patterns have the same title, only the first
one - according to the order defined above - is loaded.

When a file is modified through the web interface of Patterns, a new
pattern file is saved in the directory at the topmost of the hierarchy
defined above (1.) and the changes are stored in the database. The
original file remain untouched.
